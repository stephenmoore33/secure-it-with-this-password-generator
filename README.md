## Intro
Let's face it. You have a lot of different accounts online. A 2021 [study](https://www.statista.com/statistics/763091/us-use-of-same-online-passwords/)  reports that 20% of people use the same password for everything, while 45% of people use the same password for some sites.

We all know that we shouldn't use the same password for everything, but why do we continue to do so? It's easy to remember, perhaps.

I have a solution. When changing a password, or creating a new account you can use this password generator to create your secure login. 

Then, so you won't forget, store your login in a secure open-source password manager, like [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com).

## About this Repo
This repository will give you a series of prompts. Requesting how many characters in length you'd prefer your password to be (8 to 128), if you need special characters, upper case letters, and lowercase letters. Then the generator will automatically load your password on screen to copy and paste. 

This was a homework assignment that was assigned in my full stack web development bootcamp at Michigan State University.

It started out overwhelming and unsure where to begin, but as I progressed it became easier and more enjoyable to complete. Feel free to view my other repos and connect with me on LinkedIn or Email me if you have any questions or feedback.
